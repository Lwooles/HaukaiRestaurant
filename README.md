I introduced a W3 schools navigation bar to begin with but foudn thatg it didnt fit accesibility guidelines. It didnt work with tabbing so i changed to a bootstrap template which satisfied this criteria. 

I used light and dark text colouring to ensure that readability was clear and colours were clearly different to avaoid visibility issues. ARIA labels were used to identify areas with a screenreader. I tested with a screenreader to esnure readability.

I used H1 for main headings and H2 elements for sub headings. The P element was used for paragraphs and Ul used for unorganised lists. This was to aid the screenreader.
